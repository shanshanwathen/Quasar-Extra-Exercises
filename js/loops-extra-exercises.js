/**
 * TODO:
 * Add up the Numbers from a Single Number
 * Create a function named addUp that takes a number as an argument. Add up all the numbers from 1 to the number you passed to the function. For example, if the input is 4 then your function should return 10 because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
 *
 * Examples
 *
 * >> addUp(4) ➞ 10
 * >> addUp(13) ➞ 91
 * >> addUp(600) ➞ 180300
 *
 * Notes
 * Expect any positive number between 1 and 1000.

/**
 * TODO:
 * Count Instances of a Character in a String
 * Create a function named charCount that takes two strings as arguments and returns the number of times the first string (the single character) is found in the second string.
 *
 * Examples
 * >> charCount("a", "edabit") ➞ 1
 * >> charCount("c", "Chamber of secrets") ➞ 1
 * >> charCount("b", "big fat bubble") ➞ 4
 *
 * Notes
 * Your output must be case-sensitive (see second example).

/**
 * TODO:
 * Return the Index of the First Vowel
 * Create a function named firstVowel that returns the index of the first vowel in a string.
 *
 * Examples
 * >> firstVowel("apple") ➞ 0
 * >> firstVowel("hello") ➞ 1
 * >> firstVowel("STRAWBERRY") ➞ 3
 * >> firstVowel("pInEaPPLe") ➞ 1
 *
 * Notes
 * Input will be single words.
 * Characters in words will be upper or lower case.
 * "y" is not considered a vowel.
 * Input always contains a vowel.

/**
 * TODO:
 * Integer Digits Count
 * Create a function named count that counts the integer's number of digits.
 *
 * Examples
 *
 * >> count(318) ➞ 3
 * >> count(-92563) ➞ 5
 * >> count(4666) ➞ 4
 * >> count(-314890) ➞ 6
 * >> count(654321) ➞ 6
 * count(638476) ➞ 6
 *
 * Notes
 * For an added challenge, try to solve this without using strings.

/**
 * TODO:
 * Remove the Letters ABC
 * Create a function named removeABC that will remove the letters "a", "b" and "c" from the given string and return the modified version. If the given string does not contain "a", "b", or "c", return null.
 *
 * Examples
 * >> removeABC("This might be a bit hard") ➞ "This might e  it hrd"
 * >> removeABC("hello world!") ➞ null
 * >> removeABC("") ➞ null
 *
 * Notes
 * If the given string does not contain "a", "b", or "c", return null.

/**
 * TODO:
 * Write a function named reverseOdd that will take a string as argument, reverse all the words which have odd length. The even length words are not changed.
 *
 * Examples
 *
 * >> reverseOdd("Bananas") ➞ "sananaB"
 * >> reverseOdd("One two three four") ➞ "enO owt eerht four"
 * >> reverseOdd("Make sure uoy only esrever sdrow of ddo length") ➞ "Make sure you only reverse words of odd length"
 *
 * Notes
 * There is exactly one space between each word and no punctuation is used.
 * Should work with empty string.
 * Should work with only one word.

/**
 * TODO:
 * Convert a Number to Base-2
 * Create a function named binary that returns a base-2 (binary) representation of a base-10 (decimal) string number. To convert is simple: ((2) means base-2 and (10) means base-10) 010101001(2) = 1 + 8 + 32 + 128.
 *
 * Going from right to left, the value of the most right bit is 1, now from that every bit to the left will be x2 the value, value of an 8 bit binary numbers are (256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1).
 *
 * Examples
 * >> binary(1) ➞ "1"   // 1*1 = 1
 * >> binary(5) ➞ "101"   // 1*1 + 1*4 = 5
 * >> binary(10) ➞ "1010"   // 1*2 + 1*8 = 10
 *
 * Notes
 * Numbers will always be below 1024 (not including 1024).
 * The && operator could be useful.
 * The strings will always go to the length at which the most left bit's value gets bigger than the number in decimal.
 * If a binary conversion for 0 is attempted, return "0".
